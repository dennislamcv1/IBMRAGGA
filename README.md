## RAG for Generative AI Applications Specialization (4 course series)

Ready to build smarter applications that leverage the power of generative AI (GenAI) and real-world data? This hands-on specialization guides you through the key tools and techniques for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and gives you practical experience with vector databases, embedding models, and advanced retrieval frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex. 

You’ll gain a strong foundation in GenAI fundamentals and prompt engineering, then get hands-on building applications that combine large language models with real-world data using similarity search. Plus, you'll work with advanced vector databases like Chroma DB and FAISS to power retrieval, create recommendation systems, and construct RAG workflows from the ground up.  

By the end, you’ll know how to design, build, and evaluate RAG-enabled GenAIapps with integrated interfaces using tools like Gradio. 

If you’re looking to boost your AI engineering skills and practically apply GenAI in production environments, this 12-week program gives you the job-ready skills to hit the ground running.
